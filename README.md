# Link Discoverer

For our scraping needs, we found it useful to break up the crawl and the scrape into different libraries. This is just the crawler, which returns a deduped array of urls for a given website.

## Getting Started

``` bash
cd link-discoverer
npm i
cp .env.TEMPLATE .env
# Fill out variables in .env file.
npm run dev
```
